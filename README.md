# [Amber Smalltalk](http://amber-lang.net) application generator.

The intention of this tool is to automate the creation of Amber projects.
This tool is based on [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

It is conveniently integrated into the `amber-cli` commandline tool, which should be preferred over using this project directly with `grunt-init`.

Installation and initial getting started instructions can be found [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/amber#getting-amber).

#### Read on if you insist on doing it the [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) way

Please note that `amber-cli` performs some additional project creation steps which you will be missing if you continue this way.

Install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) if you have not already done so.

Place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory using the following command:

```
git clone git://github.com/amber-smalltalk/grunt-init-amber.git ~/.grunt-init/amber
```

_Windows users, see [the grunt-init documentation](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding) for the correct directory destination_


At the command-line, change into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```
grunt-init amber
```

_Note: this template will generate files in the current directory,
so be sure to change to a new directory first if you do not want to overwrite existing files._
